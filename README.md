lunchroom
=========

Lunchroom ordering program for a school. The admin user sets up the menu for each day of the week and each classroom uses 
the program to order items from the menu for each student. The lunchroom staff then prints out a report for the total 
orders for the day and prepares the food.

The backend is written in Node.js and the UI is written using AngularJS with Twitter's Bootstrap.
